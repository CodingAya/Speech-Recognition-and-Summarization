# Speech Recognition and Summarization 
In this project, I utilized various tools and libraries to build a comprehensive system that can transcribe spoken words, punctuate the transcripts, and generate concise summaries. It can be used for transcribing and summarizing podcasts, lecture recordings, or MP3 files in general.

**Project overview**

1. Creating a speech recognition system using vosk
2. Adding punctuation to the text transcript using recasepunc
3. Summarizing the text using a huggingface summarization pipeline


**File overview**

* `Speech Recognition with Vosk and Summarization with HuggingFace transformers.ipynb` - the code to summarize text
* `elonmusk.mp3` - a 47 second audio clip of Elon Musk talking about AI to test the model
* `elonmusk.txt` - the full transcript of `elonmusk.mp3`
